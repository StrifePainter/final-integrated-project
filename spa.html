        <p class="col-span-full">%100 of the full treatment price will be charged to your account for cancellations and no-shows made less than twelve (12) hours prior to the appointment time.</p>
        <p class="col-span-full">It is very rare that one of our Spa Professionals gets sick or has a family emergency and we understand it is extremely disappointing to not have the treatment you requested. Staff will make every effort in finding an alternative time in the day or during your stay with another therapist, sometimes involving a slightly different Treatment. We appreciate our guests for being so patient during these unforeseen circumstances. Currently if there is a cancellation and you cannot be accommodated, there will be no Spa charge to your room.</p>
        <p class="col-span-full">A Free Voucher for a 1 hour (Not RMT) Spa Treatment will now be provided for your next getaway at the Couples Resort.</p>
            <p class="col-span-full">The Policy change allows us not only to make sure there is no out of pocket expense (the cost of the treatment) but that we will also compensate you beyond what the Couples Resort could not provide you.</p>
            <p class="col-span-full">Thank You & Enjoy in Our Pleasure,</p>
            <p class="col-span-full">John Sorensen, President.</p>
