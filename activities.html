        <p class="col-span-full">No matter what time of year, there's always a lot to do at Couples Resort. Then again, who said you couldn't just relax in a deep padded chaise lounge on your own room deck and indulge in a favorite novel while resting in the soothing warmth of the day. Whatever you choose, you're sure to enjoy all of our activities.</p>
        <p class="col-span-full">The resort sits on a Semi-Private Lake, Galeairy Lake which is 11 km long reaching into Algonquin Park and 95% undeveloped so great for exploring hidden bays and exploring what nature has to offer along the shorelines. Or explore the rugged surroundings can compel you to take a guided trail ride in the Algonqin wilderness. With with direct access to 35 km of trail alongside the serene Madawaska River on an abandoned railway bed you can go mountain biking or ATVing for hours. Or take a leisurely hike on the resorts trails.</p>
        
        <h3 id=algonquin-park-title class="col-span-full">Algonquin Park</h3>
        <p class="col-span-full">This majestic park, minutes away and seen from our lake shore, is awe-inspiring and completely peaceful with the incredible beauty of nature. Come experience the Algonquin grandeur, with all its fresh clean air, deep blue skies, rich green forests and hundreds of pristine lakes.<br>
        Just steps away from The Couples Resort, Algonquin's 7,630 square kilometres of forests, lakes, and rivers have assumed an almost incalculable importance as a living link with a vanishing past.<br>
        
        Algonquin Park contains numerous historical and archaeological resources and has inspired more than 40 books, 1,800 scientific papers, a dozen films, a symphony, and the art of Tom Thomson and the Group of Seven. It also provides many opportunities for visitors to appreciate the Park's natural setting while enjoying numerous recreational activities.</p>
